This project is part of my internship at Outrix, where I completed Task 1: Student Performance Analysis. The objective was to analyze academic performance data and identify how various socio-demographic factors influence student scores.

Key Highlights:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and standardized the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used pandas, matplotlib, seaborn to visualize score distributions and patterns based on gender, parental education, lunch type, race/ethnicity, and test preparation.

Statistical Testing: Applied t-tests using scipy to evaluate the significance of differences in average scores across categories.

Correlation Analysis: Generated heatmaps to show relationships between math, reading, and writing scores.

Composite Visualization: Created violin plots to show the combined effect of test preparation and parental education on performance.

This task helped me strengthen my Python data analysis workflow and statistical reasoning.# student_analysis
