 Data Science Internship Projects â€“ Outrix

This repository contains a collection of data science mini-projects completed as part of my internship at **Outrix**. Each project demonstrates the application of core data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques using Python. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with real-world data problems, understand workflows, and apply statistical reasoning.

 1. Student Performance Analysis

Task 1 of my internship focused on analyzing academic performance data to explore how socio-demographic factors influence student scores.

Key Concepts:
- Data preprocessing and cleanup
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical testing (t-tests using `scipy`)
- Correlation heatmaps and violin plots

Tech Stack:
- pandas
- seaborn, matplotlib
- scipy.stats

 Key Highlights:
- Analyzed relationships between gender, race/ethnicity, lunch type, and parental education on math, reading, and writing scores
- Used violin plots to show effects of test preparation and parental education on scores
- Built strong foundations in data visualization and hypothesis testing



2. Movie Recommendation System

A content-based recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a user-provided title based on plot descriptions.

 Key Concepts:
- TF-IDF vectorization of movie overviews
- Cosine similarity computation
- Text preprocessing and filtering
- Efficient recommendation retrieval

Tech Stack:
- pandas
- scikit-learn (TF-IDF, cosine similarity)

 Features:
- Handles up to 5,000 movies from `movies_metadata.csv`
- Returns top 5 similar titles based on overview text
- Easily adaptable for larger datasets or TMDb API integration



3. Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on income and spending behavior, helping understand customer types for targeted marketing.

 Key Concepts:
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Clustering with KMeans (3 clusters)
- Data visualization using seaborn

 Tech Stack:
- pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (KMeans, StandardScaler)

   Output:
- Clustered 2D scatter plot visualizing customer groups
- Insight into behavioral patterns based on annual income and spending score
